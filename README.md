## A few facts about me. A dude who likes to program for fun.

> GPL-3 and other Gnu licenses aren't "more restrictive" than other licenses. MIT and permissive licenses in general are for dev-cucks who write proprietary software for free.

Hello there, chaps. My name is *Omar* :3 people usually call me *"Vent"* or *"VentGrey"* (online...that is). 

I'm a software developer, sysadmin and DevOps specialist (most of the time). My devotion to the principles of free software is unwavering, and I take great pride in watching my mates grow and expand their various free (libre) software repositories on GitHub.

Most of my personal interests revolve around computers, web development isn't that interesting for me. I, However, find myself disheartened by the current trend of over-engineering websites. In a world of needless complexity, the elegance of sysadmin work shines through. I'm not saying the web sucks...much. *BUT* we do need sysadmins too so, should you require assistance in this area, do not hesitate to seek me out. I am more than willing to lend a hand.

I **LOVE** to write my own software. But I do not seek to diminish the skills or accomplishments of other programmers, nor declare that my stack is superior to all others. I write software purely for the sake of enjoyment and to expand my knowledge of the art.

> After receiving some questions about it I've decided to answer why some of my repos have a worked-out README file and a fancy social-preview image. It's simple, I like to keep things my way and leave them "well-done" even if the only user is myself. I don't do those presentation changes for others but for myself :)

## Other things I love :heart:

* :notes: I love progressive Rock / Metal. Specially Steven Wilson and Opeth :metal:
* :smiley_cat: Cats, cause those are the *cutest* animal on earth.
* :star2: viewing repos of my comrades.
* :grey_question: Not knowing things.
* Microsoft can shoo itself out of here >:(

## My GitHub status. This thing is to showoff...isn't it? :thinking:

| C++ with a better syntax	 | The only thing better than not having to manage memory is feeling morally superior about it.	  |  Where you can mix business logic with presentation logic, just like putting a pineapple on a pizza  |  Because who needs readable syntax? |  Because you're not a real programmer until you've compiled something from a text editor	  | For when you need to glue things together, but also want to eat the glue |

## Unpopular Opinions :persevere:

Rants about what technology should or should not be. 

> I'd like to say *no hard feelings* but I would be lying.

* Technology **IS NOT** politics, focus on science and innovation. Science calls upon us to solve problems with our intellect and ingenuity.
* The only obsolete and useless programming languages are the ones you cannot master with your current skill.
* Those who claim that C and C++ are insecure and super-dangerous are often those who fail to keep up with new standards and are not skilled in those languages.
* Horrible code comes from horrible programmers.
* `-O3` doesn't produce faulty code, if it does, your code is wrong, not the compiler.
* The `gnome-keyring-daemon` fucking sucks, but alas, there is no better alternative.
* CORS shouldn't exist. It's just here to dumb things even more.
* YAML sucks :neutral_face: (2024 update, it still sucks)
* "Cross platform" usually means "Web interface" which isn't really better
* Using a lot of dependencies doesn't make a project "smart" it makes it "bloated"
* Some garbage **IS NOT OK**
* The popular mindset of "Customers don't care how you did it, they care that software just works" is precisely what's making us drown in bugs.
* The abundance of memory and storage should not be used as an excuse for inefficient software.
* To keep things simple, we must exercise our minds and avoid succumbing to laziness, for simplicity in our software is not a difficult task.
* Chromium DNS issues solved by flushing the DNS and socket pools **IN THE BROWSER** just proves that Google is indeed full of morons.
