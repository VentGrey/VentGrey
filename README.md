## A few facts about me

Hello there, chaps. My name is *Omar* :3 people usually call me *"Vent"* or *"VentGrey"* (online...that is). 

I'm a software developer, sysadmin and DevOps specialist (most of the time), a highly-proud free-software (as in freedom) activist and a happy contributor to free software repositories so, if I follow you on GitHub I will probably look all your repos and enjoy your work. 

Most of my personal interests revolve around computers, web development isn't that interesting for me (tho, it gives me food), mostly because nowadays people just compete on who over-engineers more their websites. For me sysadmin stuff rocks! and so programming languages like C, Rust, Pascal, etc. I'm not saying the web sucks...much. *BUT* we do need sysadmins too so I'll be happy to assist you if you happen to need help :wink:

## Other things I love :heart:

* :notes: I love progressive Rock / Metal. Specially Steven Wilson and Opeth :metal:
* :smiley_cat: Cats, cause those are the *cutest* animal on earth.
* :star2: viewing repos of my comrades.
* :grey_question: Not knowing things.
* Proprietary big-tech can shoo itself out of here.

## Support :heart:

If you want to help me continue make free (as in freedom) software you can consider inviting me a coffee here :)

## Unpopular Opinions :persevere:

* Technology **IS NOT** politics, focus on science and innovation those are more important than "which term is more or less inclusive", "is this issue too toxic?" and other things. Science needs you to solve problems with your head :heart:
  * "B-but...everything is politics". Go to a politics place then, the compiler didn't, doesn't and won't ever care which social movement you side with.
* Codes Of Conduct **SOMETIMES** are absolutely ridiculous and sometimes kill projects sometimes by banning good contributors for reasons arbitrary to their coding skills.
* One rude **BUT** good contributor is worth more than a hunded kind and flawed ones.
* The only obsolete and useless programming languages are the ones you cannot master with your current skill.
  * "But PHP is old and..." yes, we heard you boi who cannot be productive without `npm install`.
* C and C++ aren't insecure and **super-dangerous**, devs don't read new standards and they suck at C/C++.
* Horrible code comes from horrible programmers.
* `-O3` doesn't produce faulty code, if it does, your code is wrong, not the compiler.
* The `gnome-keyring-daemon` fucking sucks but there is no good alternative to it.
* YAML sucks :neutral_face: (2023 update, it still sucks)
* "Cross platform" usually means "Web interface" which isn't really better
* Using a lot of dependencies doesn't make a project "smart" it makes it "bloated"
* Some garbage **IS NOT OK**
* The popular mindset of "Customers don't care how you did it, they care that software just works" is precisely what's making us drown in bugs.
* "We have too much memory nowadays", "We have massive storage" are just excuses for people who can't build efficient software.
* Making things simple isn't difficult, y'all just too lazy to think sometimes (myself included).
