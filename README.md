## A few facts about me

Hello there, chaps. My name is *Omar* :3 people usually call me *"Vent"* or *"VentGrey"* (online...that is). 

I'm a software developer, sysadmin and DevOps specialist (most of the time). My devotion to the principles of free software is unwavering, and I take great pride in watching my mates grow and expand their various open-source repositories on GitHub.

Most of my personal interests revolve around computers, web development isn't that interesting for me. However, I find myself disheartened by the current trend of over-engineering websites. In a world of needless complexity, the elegance of sysadmin work shines through. I'm not saying the web sucks...much. *BUT* we do need sysadmins too so Should you require assistance in this area, do not hesitate to seek me out. I am more than willing to lend a hand.

I **LOVE** to write my own software. But I do not seek to diminish the skills or accomplishments of other programmers, nor declare that my stack is superior to all others. I write software purely for the sake of enjoyment and to expand my knowledge of the art.

## Other things I love :heart:

* :notes: I love progressive Rock / Metal. Specially Steven Wilson and Opeth :metal:
* :smiley_cat: Cats, cause those are the *cutest* animal on earth.
* :star2: viewing repos of my comrades.
* :grey_question: Not knowing things.
* Proprietary big-tech can shoo itself out of here.

## Support :heart:

| C++ with a better syntax	 | The only thing better than not having to manage memory is feeling morally superior about it.	  |  Where you can mix business logic with presentation logic, just like putting a pineapple on a pizza  |  SHell: because who needs good syntax? |  Because you're not a real programmer until you've compiled something from a text editor	  | Golang: for when you need to glue things together, but also want to eat the glue |

## Unpopular Opinions :persevere:

* Technology **IS NOT** politics, focus on science and innovation those are more important than "which term is more or less inclusive", "is this issue too toxic?" and other things. Science calls upon us to solve problems with our intellect and ingenuity.
  * "But...everything is politics". Go to a politics place then, the compiler didn't, doesn't and won't ever care which social movement you side with.
* Codes of conduct can be both beneficial and detrimental to a project. Sometimes, they can be entirely ridiculous and lead to the dismissal of valuable contributors for arbitrary reasons unrelated to their coding skills.
* It is better to have one rude yet talented contributor than a hundred kind yet mediocre ones.
* The only obsolete and useless programming languages are the ones you cannot master with your current skill.
  * "But PHP is old and..." yes, we heard you boi who cannot be productive without `npm install`.
* Those who claim that C and C++ are insecure and super-dangerous are often those who fail to keep up with new standards and are not skilled in those languages.
* Horrible code comes from horrible programmers.
* `-O3` doesn't produce faulty code, if it does, your code is wrong, not the compiler.
* The `gnome-keyring-daemon` fucking sucks, but alas, there is no better alternative.
* YAML sucks :neutral_face: (2023 update, it still sucks)
* "Cross platform" usually means "Web interface" which isn't really better
* Using a lot of dependencies doesn't make a project "smart" it makes it "bloated"
* Some garbage **IS NOT OK**
* The popular mindset of "Customers don't care how you did it, they care that software just works" is precisely what's making us drown in bugs.
* The abundance of memory and storage should not be used as an excuse for inefficient software.
* To keep things simple, we must exercise our minds and avoid succumbing to laziness, for simplicity in our software is not a difficult task.
