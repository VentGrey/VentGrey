## A few facts about me

Hello there, chaps. My name is *Omar* :3 people usually call me *"Vent"* or *"VentGrey"* (online...that is). 

I'm a Mexican software developer, sysadmin and DevOps specialist (most of the time), a highly-proud free-software (as in freedom) activist and a happy contributor to free software repositories so, if I follow you on GitHub I will probably look all your repos for the sake of curiosity. 

Most of my personal interests revolve around computers and it's internals, the world-wide popular web development isn't that interesting for me, especially because nowadays people just compete on who over-engineers more their apps. So for me Sysadmin stuff rocks! and so programming languages like C, Rust, Pascal, etc. I'm not saying the web sucks...much. *BUT* we do need sysadmins too so I'll be happy to assist you if you happen to need help :wink:

## Other things I love :heart:

* :notes: I love progressive Rock / Metal. Specially Steven Wilson and Opeth :metal:
* :smiley_cat: Cats, cause those are the *cutest* animal on earth.
* :penguin: GÃ±u loonex.
* :musical_keyboard: Piano :D
* :star2: viewing repos of my comrades.
* :grey_question: Not knowing things.
* [M.A.A.N.G](https://www.google.com/search?q=Faang&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi_yLSa5I_0AhXnQzABHSEpDt8Q_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1912&bih=951&dpr=1#imgrc=TM_p40biC2XpqM) can shoo itself out of this profile. (It stands fot Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google)

## :warning: Before contacting me, PLEASE READ THIS. (Trust me, it will save us future problems)

As much as I like to keep it friendly when it comes to the coding community around me, these cancel culture supporters are utterly disgusting. Trying to rule out people by things non related to their jobs it's a sign of low IQ and poor problem solving skills. Mostly because this doesn't terminate social problems correctly, you have more intolerant people under the carpet, you just pretend they aren't there.
  
For this matter I'm refraining to contact or support anyone who has participated in these kind of activities, also please don't try to tell me about the "Paradox of tolerance" there are countless articles that show how Karl Popper's words were terribly misunderstood and now is being used wildly by emotional strawman-fallacy masters around the web (specially on twitter). Here is [one of those articles](https://epoje.es/la-paradoja-de-la-paradoja-de-la-tolerancia/) just in case you are interested.

If you are a "Cancel Culture" supporter or if you've cancelled anyone in the past, please refrain from contacting me, listen to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=civuoU_NE38) instead. I don't speculate, I **KNOW** for a fact that you don't have anything of interest to show or offer here, people with poor problem solving skills are not in my interest list `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`
</p>
  
Also yes, I signed the RMS support letter.


## My GitHub status. This thing is to showoff...isn't it? :thinking:

### Programming Languages I'd LOVE to learn:
* Julia (The purple matlab thingy)
* Vala (Kotlin for GNOME)
* C++ (C that takes years to compile)
* ASM/LLVM (Suffering made easy)
* Kotlin :calling: (Java created by people who makes expensive IDE's)

### Other Programming Languages I've used but I'm not really interested mastering:

* Python :snake: (Pseudocode that works)
* Perl :camel: (Write scripts that *only you* can understand)
* Java :coffee: (Object is an object whose parent is object at the object class)
* Scala :coffee:++ (Java that works)
* C# (Java made by windows guys)
* Lisp ((((((lisp))))))
* JavaScript (I was about to make a joke here but there is already a framework for that)
* Typescript (I was about to make a joke here but there is already a framework for that: Any)
* Dart (*ANOTHER* google language?)
* Ruby (Not in a million years)
* R (R => R)

## Unpopular Opinions :persevere:

* Technology **IS NOT** politics, focus on science and innovation those are more important than "which term is more or less inclusive", "is this issue too toxic?" and other things. Science needs you to solve problems with your head :heart:
* Codes Of Conduct **SOMETIMES** are absolutely ridiculous and sometimes kill projects sometimes by banning good contributors for reasons arbitrary to their coding skills.
* One rude **BUT** good contributor is worth more than a hunded kind and flawed ones.
* JavaScript is not the future, it is only more popular (it is also uglier than a ðŸš™ upside down).
* The only obsolete and useless programming languages are the ones you cannot master with your current skill.
* C and C++ aren't insecure and **super-dangerous**, devs don't read new standards and they suck at C/C++.
* Even if Rust is king :crab: it's highly-verbose syntax is higly carcinogenic :sweat_smile:
* Newer languages aren't **THAT** awesome as they claim to be. 
* Serverless, Containers and other *"popular terms"* have been around for too long. Someone just found how to make them popular using ridiculous names.
* PHP isn't *"obsolete"* or *"dead"*. It also doesn't have horrible code. Horrible code comes from horrible programmers.
* `-O3` doesn't produce faulty code, if it does, your code is wrong, not the compiler.
* O'Caml is scary :ghost: :camel:
* YAML sucks :neutral_face:
* "Cross platform" usually means "Web interface" which isn't really better
* Using a lot of dependencies doesn't make a project "smart" it makes it "bloated"
* Some garbage **IS NOT OK**
* The popular mindset of "the client doesn't care how you did it, it cares that the project just works" is precisely the one who is making us drown in bugs.
* Frameworks are becoming developer friendly but machine agressive.
* "We have too much memory nowadays", "We have massive storage" are just excuses for people who can't build efficient software.
* Static binaries are bloated
